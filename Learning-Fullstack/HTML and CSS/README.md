# **HTML & CSS Layout Mastery**

This project is a collection of exercises and a major clone designed to practice and master fundamental and advanced CSS layout techniques, including **Flexbox**, **Positioning**, and **CSS Grid**. It demonstrates a strong foundation in modern web styling and responsive design principles.

## **🚀 Projects and Key Concepts**

This repository contains three main HTML exercises, each focusing on a specific area of CSS layout.

| File | Primary Focus | Key Concepts Demonstrated |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **youtube.html** | **Comprehensive Layout Practice** | **CSS Grid** for main video arrangement and info blocks; **Positioning** (fixed and absolute) for the persistent Header, Sidebar, and video time badges; **Flexbox** for aligning elements within the header and sidebar icons; **Media Queries** for responsiveness. |
| **flexbox.html** | **Flexbox Layout** | Practices using display: flex for horizontal and vertical alignment, spacing control (justify-content: space-between), and centering items within complex containers (e.g., creating aligned header bars). |
| **position.html** | **CSS Position Property** | Focuses on position: relative and position: absolute to create layered UI effects, such as a **"New" promotion badge** and a **hover-activated overlay** (Add to Cart button). |
