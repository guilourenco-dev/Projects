# My University & Personal Projects

This repository contains all my programming projects — both from university and personal experiments.

## IST Projects

### Fundamentos da Programação (FP)
- **FP Project 1 – MNK game (Grade: 14):** Python program where a human player can play against the computer in a general m×n grid game with k in a row to win.
- **FP Project 2 – Orbito-n (Grade: 14):** Python implementation of a variation of the Orbito game, using abstract data types and custom functions to manage game logic and moves.

### Lógica de Programação (LP)
- **LP Project – Star Battle Solver (Grade: 20):** Prolog program to solve Star Battle puzzles by placing stars on an NxN board while respecting the rules for rows, columns, and regions. Includes custom data structures and predicates to manage the puzzle logic.

### IAED
- **Vaccine Management System (Grade: 19):** C program implementing a system for managing vaccines and inoculations. Supports adding vaccine batches, applying doses to users, listing vaccines, and advancing simulated time. Handles errors and memory constraints. All source and header files are in the `src` folder.
